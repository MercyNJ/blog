This repository contains the client code for the 'blog-app' repositor code.

Just a copy of the client side code to allow me make adjustments necessary to build the client side code for production.

Such adjustments included adjusting hardcoded urls i had used for local development eg const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/post', {      to const response = await fetch('/post', {
